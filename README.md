## About Project

This is my first project using laravel
It is a website for a programming company, as soon as the home page is opened, it appears to the user at the bottom of the page, a form through which he can send a message in which the request he wants, such as creating a website or a mobile application. It also contains an admin panel, through which it is possible to delete, create, update and read data From the database, through which we can register employees for the company and give access to the control panel for some people only, through which users can view requests and also display the number of site visits
